			<h5>Distributed Implementation of Seizure Detection Algorithm</h5>
			<div class = "project_hashtag">#DistributedML #RandomForest #SignalProcessing #Spark</div>
			<p>
				In this study, we explored the cross-disciplinary application of distributed machine learning in healthcare sensing. The goal was to develop
        a distributed implementation for seizure detections algorithms based on canine and human electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings provided by Mayo
        Clinic. The algorithm was designed to determine if a given EEG signal clip was within seizure stage, early seizure stage (within 15s before
        seizure), or neither. Driven by the need to incorporate large-scale data labeling and potential application in real-time detection, this
        independent study further extended the algorithm to big data scenarios by building distributed training and prediction pipelines. One potential
         application of this study is a data annotation system capable of annotating massive unlabelled EEG data in parallel. Another real-world end
         product example could be a wearable low-latency seizure prevention device that processes real-time EEG signals as streaming data.

			<h5>Wharton Analytics Fellows Program: L'Oreal Employee Analysis</h5>
			<div class = "project_hashtag">#DataAnalytics #AttributionAnalysis #Jupyter #Tableu</div>
			<p>
        We collaborated with L'Oreal to analyze employee exit interview and pulse surveys to determine the potential drivers of employee engagement.
        We are also provided with collected employee profiles, perforamance and motivation. Key questions we desired to anwser include:
        <br>- How do employee data and survey / interview results explain employee engagement scores?
        <br>- Based on data analysis, what are the key drivers of employee engagement at L’Oreal, with specific focus on managers and their teams?
        <br>- What actions could L’Oreal take to boost employee motivation?

      <h5>Moving Object Recognition and Tracking in Videos</h5>
      <div class = "project_hashtag">#ComputerVision #R-CNN #OpticalFlow #ObjectRecognition #OpenCV </div>
      <p>
        Object recognition is refers to a collection of related tasks for identifying objects in digital photographs. In this course project,
        we devised approaches to recognize and track objects in videos without having to exhaustively feed each frame to object detection NN model
        to reduce computation costs. We parsed videos with OpenCV and employed a pre-trained Mask R-CNN model to recognize objects from 81 possible classes
        and generate bounding boxes in first frames of videos. Then we coded up an iterative image processing procedure to track objects in subsequent frames
        with KLT optical flow method based on inherited bounding boxes from first frame and identified moving objects in sliding cameras.

			<h5>Knowledge Building in Online Data Science Competitions</h5>
			<div class = "project_hashtag">#DataScience #ComputationalNotebooks #OnlineCommunity #Kaggle</div>
			<p>
				Knowledge building is a prevalent feature in open online systems, but it is challenging to motivate participants to contribute and to maintain quality in their contributions. In the context of Kaggle, an online data science community where community knowledge is curated in the form of shared computational notebooks, we explored how competitions could be used as a potential design model to incentivize contribution. By interviewing 14 Kaggle participants, we found that competitive mechanisms could be used to motivate experts to contribute to shared knowledge, but could create challenges for beginners to do so. We offered design implications for effectively implementing competitive mechanisms that could benefit both expert and beginner participants in future knowledge building systems.

			<h5>Data Science Narrative in Computational Notebooks</h5>
			<div class = "project_hashtag">#DataScience #ComputationalNotebooks</div>
			<p>
			 In 2017, I worked with Prof. <a href="http://hci.ucsd.edu/hollan" class="linkto" target = "blank">Jim Hollan</a> and Dr. <a href="http://adamrule.com/" class="linkto" target = "blank">Adam Rule</a> in the <a href="http://designlab.ucsd.edu" class="linkto" target = "blank">UCSD Design Lab</a> to study the narrative features among the Jupyter Notebooks using by the scientific data analysts community. I helped with building a dataset of 1.5 million computational notebooks and metadata and conducting thematic analysis and topic modeling. The resulting <a href="http://adamrule.com/files/papers/chi_2018_computational_notebooks_camera_ready.pdf" class="linkto" target = "blank">paper</a> won an Honorable Mention award in CHI2018! We also built Jupyter Notebook extensions to support narrative in data analysis.

			<h5>Data science education through computational notebooks (2017)</h5>
			<p>
			 In this project I also worked with the Activity History team. We studied the usage of Jupyter Notebooks in a introductory data science class. We observed how instructors and students use Jupyter Notebooks for teaching/learning data science and summarized the "painful points" in this process. We are working on submitting our findings to CHI 2018 student research competition. We are also builidng Jupyter Notebook extensions to solve some problems we observed. Here is a extension I built to assist beginning learners clean up import packages, check back for more extensions!
